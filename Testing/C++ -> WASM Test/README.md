this was a test to see how C++ compiled to WASM so i could understand what specifically was going on with the code

note: this is not—by any means—a finished product. this was simply for me to see how the C++ libraries would compile to WASM & JS so i could figure out how to parse the compiled binaries

wasm and such will be uploaded to a separate provider as to not skew the language stuff (there was far too much)
